# Tweeter Deleter

Deletes old Tweets! ü´°üê¶

View help with `go run ./cmd/deleter -h`
```
  -force
    	Actually delete tweets. If unset, command only prints number of potentially affected tweets without deleting tweets.
  -verbose
    	Print out all (potentially) deleted tweets
  -year int
    	Maximum allowable tweet age in years (default 10)
```

**Caveat: if you are a Big Poster and have over 3200, this script might have issues. Twitter's user timeline API has a 3200 tweet limit. Good luck with that ü§∑**
